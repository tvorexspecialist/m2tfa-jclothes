=====================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/magento-hackathon/Magento-Two-factor-Authentication.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/magento-hackathon/Magento-Two-factor-Authentication) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/magento-hackathon/Magento-Two-factor-Authentication/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/magento-hackathon/Magento-Two-factor-Authentication)

Implementation of an two-factor-authentication using Google's 2-Step Verification algorithm.

### Abstract

Admin (backend) users whose role's resources are in the list of protected resources,
are asked to enter one-time security code generated by the Google Authenticator app on their mobile phone after
they have authenticated themselves in the admin by using standard login dialog.
This ensures that critical resources in the admin have extra protection layer that cannot be accessed
by third parties without one-time security code. It includes cases when someone's laptop is stolen or accessed
by third parties.

> **NOTE:**
> Default login will be also required to login!
> 2FA is only an additional login to increase the security.

### How to use it

- Install Google Authenticator app to your smartphone
- Install this extension via composer or modman
- Log in to Magento admin
- You will be requested to scan the QR code with the Google Authenticator app and define security questions
- Continue Log in

### TBD

- Write docs about how to install this extension to your Magento with composer.
